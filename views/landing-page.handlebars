            <p> What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of
                the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
                the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when
                an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
                make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
                but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
